#Angular Template Project

This project is a grunt project. You need a running [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and
[bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) installation.

##Installation

Fork this project on github and/or download this project from github as a ZIP file.

After that, in the project root, issue the following commands:

	npm install
	bower install

Done.

##Features

This project is a skeleton to use for new angular projects. It works out of the box without changes and contains
all the boiler plate code to setup a new project. It contains hooks for your production code, unit tests,
deployment, module loading and much more.

The following libraries are used:

* [angularJS](http://angularjs.org/) (of course)
* [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) (for dependeny management of javascript libraries to be loaded in browser)
* [requireJS](http://requirejs.org/) (for javascript module loading and optimization)
* [jslint](http://www.jslint.com/) (for quality checking of javascript code)
* [grunt-manifest](https://github.com/gunta/grunt-manifest) (an appcache manifest will be created while creating a deployable artifact)
* [grunt-targethtml](https://github.com/changer/grunt-targethtml) (filtering of html files for deployment on production servers)
* [grunt-data-uri](https://github.com/ahomu/grunt-data-uri) Embeds all referenced images in css files in the project css file, which is optimized by grunt
* [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) (as a test runner for unit tests and ui tests)

###Differences to yeoman
This project is very similar to [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). As much as I like yeoman and how cool it is to use it, its also very
heavy as a technology stack. This project is much lighter (besides node, grunt and bower, you need nothing installed) with
similar, but hardcoded (and thus limited) features.

There are no features like yeoman generators. Its just a project with as much freedom as **I** (Marco Rinck) like.

##Usage

While running local web server following actions will be run automatically:
	* unit-tests (after changes in javascript files)
	* live reloading of ressources (after changes in HTML/JS/CSS files)

To start the local web server:

	grunt web

Create a deployable artifact for your real webserver:

	grunt install

List all packages and their licenses this project depends on, in case your boss wants to know that.

 	grunt license

###Images

Image files which are referenced in the project css files will be automatically embedded into the generated and
optimized css file of the project as data URIs. Images file need to placed into the *images* folder to be found.

Though data URI images are ~30% bigger than the original image, the browser saves heavily on HTTP requests. Thus, for
for icons its usually faster to load them as data URIs than directly via HTTP.

**Warning**: No images inside the *images* folder will be included in the artifact generated by the *grunt install* goal.
If you need to deploy images on your webserver (usually only bigger images like in galleries) you need to place them into the
*images/build* folder.
